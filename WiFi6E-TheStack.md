Below is a **simplified view** of the **Wi-Fi 6E** (IEEE 802.11ax in the 6 GHz band) protocol stack, along with brief **layer responsibilities**. Although Wi-Fi 6E specifically targets the 6 GHz band, the fundamental **802.11** MAC and PHY architecture remains similar to Wi-Fi 6 (5 GHz/2.4 GHz)—just adapted to new spectrum rules and features.

> **Note:**  
> - **Wi-Fi 6E** uses the **802.11ax** standard but in the newly allocated **6 GHz** band (5.925–7.125 GHz in many regions).  
> - The diagram above shows the typical **OSI layering** for a Wi-Fi device (station or AP). Both ends (STA and AP) generally have the **same** layered stack, with roles differing in association/authentication control.

## **Layer-by-Layer Responsibilities**

### **1. Application Layer**
- **What it does**: Runs user applications and services (e.g., web browsing, streaming, VoIP).  
- **Wi-Fi Consideration**: Data generated here eventually needs reliable or best-effort transmission over the IP layer, then encapsulated into 802.11 frames.

### **2. Transport Layer (TCP/UDP/QUIC)**
- **What it does**: Handles **end-to-end** data flow control and error recovery (TCP) or best-effort delivery (UDP). QUIC runs on top of UDP for modern web transport.  
- **Wi-Fi Consideration**: Congestion control and retransmissions here operate end-to-end. However, Wi-Fi’s MAC can also do its own frame-level retransmissions, so efficient interplay with TCP is important for overall performance.

### **3. Network Layer (IP)**
- **What it does**: Manages logical addressing and routing of packets (IPv4 or IPv6).  
- **Wi-Fi Consideration**: From the network’s perspective, the Wi-Fi link is just another Layer 2 hop; however, the Wi-Fi MAC must seamlessly carry IP packets, sometimes bridging or NATing at the AP.

### **4. LLC (Logical Link Control - 802.2)**
- **What it does**: Sits between MAC and Network layers, providing a common interface and optionally multiplexing protocols (EtherType).  
- **Wi-Fi Consideration**: In most modern Wi-Fi implementations, LLC overhead is minimal but still formally part of the 802.11 architecture.

### **5. MAC Sublayer (IEEE 802.11)**
- **What it does**:  
  - **Channel Access**: Uses **CSMA/CA** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) to avoid collisions on the shared medium.  
  - **Frame Exchange**: Manages **Data frames**, **Management frames** (beacons, probes, association requests/responses), and **Control frames** (ACK, RTS/CTS).  
  - **Security**: Implements **WPA2/WPA3** encryption and authentication (EAP/802.1X or PSK), handling the handshake and key derivation.  
  - **QoS and Scheduling**: With **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6/6E)**, includes **OFDMA** scheduling at the MAC level, **BSS coloring**, **TWT** (Target Wake Time) for power saving, and **MU-MIMO** resource management.  
  - **Aggregation**: Frames can be aggregated (A-MPDU/A-MSDU) to improve efficiency and reduce overhead.  

- **Wi-Fi 6E-Specific Considerations**:  
  - Must comply with **6 GHz** regulatory rules, which often distinguish **Low Power Indoor (LPI)** from **Standard Power** (with Automated Frequency Coordination, AFC).  
  - Additional channels and reduced interference (since 6 GHz is less crowded) can significantly improve throughput and reduce congestion.

### **6. PHY Layer (IEEE 802.11ax in 6 GHz)**
- **What it does**:  
  - **Physical Modulation & Coding**: 802.11ax uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing), OFDMA (multi-user version), and up to **1024-QAM** modulation.  
  - **MU-MIMO & Beamforming**: Multi-user MIMO to serve multiple stations simultaneously, plus beamforming to improve signal gain and coverage.  
  - **Channelization**: In 6 GHz, wide channels (e.g., 160 MHz, 320 MHz in the future) are possible.  
  - **Preamble / Pilots**: Coordinates synchronization, channel estimation, and allows for multi-user scheduling.

- **Wi-Fi 6E-Specific Considerations**:  
  - Larger contiguous bandwidth in 6 GHz (up to **1.2 GHz** of spectrum in some regions) yields more available channels.  
  - Shorter range than 2.4/5 GHz due to higher frequency (more path loss, less wall penetration).

## **STA vs. AP Perspective**

Although both **stations (STAs)** (laptops, phones) and the **AP** (wireless router or enterprise AP) implement the full 802.11 stack, their **roles** differ, especially at the MAC sublayer:

1. **AP**  
   - Broadcasts **Beacon** frames, manages **association/authentication** requests.  
   - Coordinates **OFDMA** resource allocations (uplink/downlink).  
   - Often handles **bridging** to a wired LAN or upstream gateway (IP routing/NAT).

2. **Station**  
   - Scans for AP beacons, selects an AP to connect.  
   - Requests **association** and negotiates security keys.  
   - Receives resource allocations from the AP for uplink transmissions under OFDMA (or still uses EDCA if not OFDMA-scheduled).

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Wi-Fi 6E** expands **802.11ax** into the 6 GHz band, but the fundamental **MAC/PHY** layering is consistent with earlier Wi-Fi generations (just with new features for higher efficiency and more available channels).  
- **PHY** enhancements: **OFDMA**, **MU-MIMO**, **wider channels**, and advanced modulation schemes for high throughput.  
- **MAC** enhancements: Efficient scheduling (OFDMA at the MAC), better QoS handling, **BSS coloring** to mitigate interference, and improved power-saving features (TWT).  
- **Upper Layers** (LLC, IP, TCP/UDP) remain mostly unchanged; they benefit from the improved throughput and lower latency at Layers 1 and 2.  

In essence, the **Wi-Fi 6E** stack remains faithful to the **OSI model** but features major upgrades in the **MAC/PHY** layers to handle new spectrum rules, higher data rates, and more advanced multi-user operations—particularly important in dense environments and emerging high-bandwidth applications.
