# The Study of 5G And WiFi Architectures
The Study of 5G and WiFi Archiectures approaches it in terms of  
1. The Why, Considerations and User Requirements which led to the Approach.
2. The Stack and each layers and its responsibilities.
3. What factors in the enviornment influence them and how.

in 5G we have captured the [why](https://github.com/Abh4git/5GAndWiFiArchitectures/blob/main/5GArchitecture-TheWhy.md), the [considerations](https://github.com/Abh4git/5GAndWiFiArchitectures/blob/main/5GArchitecture-Considerations.md) the stack as [Part1](https://github.com/Abh4git/5GAndWiFiArchitectures/blob/main/5GArchitecture-TheStack-Part1.md) and [Part2](https://github.com/Abh4git/5GAndWiFiArchitectures/blob/main/5GArchitecture-TheStack-Part2.md) and the [enironment](https://github.com/Abh4git/5GAndWiFiArchitectures/blob/main/5GArchitecture-Envronment.md)
  
In case of WiFi particularly 6E the [why](https://github.com/Abh4git/5GAndWiFiArchitectures/blob/main/WiFi-6E-TheWhy.md) explains the resonining behind it, the [considerations,environment,challenges](https://github.com/Abh4git/5GAndWiFiArchitectures/blob/main/WiFi6E-ConsiderationsChallenges.md) and the [stack](https://github.com/Abh4git/5GAndWiFiArchitectures/blob/main/WiFi6E-TheStack.md)
